DAO's are a programmable equivalent to a legal cooperation with all the limited
liability bells and whistles, with on-chain governance and voting on proposals,
company treasury management and membership rules.

Network states are aligned online communities with a physical presence 
of crowdfunded territories enforcing it's own set of normalised rules and regulations.

Balaji's own vision of how an implementation of a Network State would look or
behave like can be called as an Balajian Network State that kind of leans
towards Balajian-liberalisation (Balaji-liberal). 

The two kinds of Network States further classified by Vitalik are:
* Lifestyle Immersion
  * Only Vegan Shops
  * Organic Farming
  * Permaculture Practises
  * Mud and natural building
* Regulatory Innovation Zones:
  * Pro-Tech Regulatory
  * Walk around Naked
  * Medical sovereignty, FDA-free
  * Legalized Cannabis
  * Using Kleros exclusively for Arbitration
