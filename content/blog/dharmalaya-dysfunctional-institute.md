Dharmalaya is 6-acres eco-campus nestled near a Village in Himachal Pradesh.
The institute is built as a place to keep alive
traditional natural building and agricultural practises while taking an intentional
and contemplative approach to learning, sharing these techniques
and bringing them to the modern era.

I visited the institute for a 3-months permaculture course led by an
Australian Permaculture teacher Robyn Hewson.

The whole idea and messaging around the philosophy of the institute sounds
good on paper or when you hear it from the co-founder of the place through his
building a better world program, however it's just that, pretty sounding words
and ideas wrapped up in analogies like natural creativity, natural harmony,
natural being. There's hardly any embodiment or execution of these ideas within the
institute or the people running the institute on the ground now.
