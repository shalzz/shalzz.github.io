Contact Improvisation (CI) is perhaps the most modern Somatics practice that I've come
across that combines the elements and principles of Dance, Martial Arts and
perhaps some spiritual practices like Yoga and Chinese Medicine science of
Chi (Tai Chi and Qi Gong), and so it feels like a breath of fresh air among
other popular Somatic approaches like Yoga or Martial Arts,
which were all conceived and developed over thousand years ago and no longer remain
relevant in today's era.

CI is a practise that not only builds on top of the
principles of these few ancient somatic practises (gravity, sense of physical touch,
momentum) but makes it a social phenomena for human connection, something that is
no longer alive with yoga or martial arts in modern day to day life.

Sure there are yoga communities and martial art classes where people come
together and practise in groups but the disciple itself doesn't have any sense
of an open "jam" or playground where you test your skills and perception with
others in real time. Open Jams are undoubtedly a part of the CI practise and
not tacked-on on top as a glue for a missing social layer.

It is this improvisational aspect of CI, no drills or steps of poses followed in sequence,
that makes CI so beautifully new, deep and a reflection of the present world
every time you practise it.
