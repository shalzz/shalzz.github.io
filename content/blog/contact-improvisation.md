Contact Improvisation (CI) is perhaps the most modern Somatics practice that I've come
across that combines the elements and principles of Dance, Aikido and
perhaps some spiritual practices like Yoga and Chinese Medicine science of
Chi (Tai Chi and Qi Gong), and so it feels like a breath of fresh air among
other popular Somatic approaches like Yoga or Martial Arts on their own,
which were all conceived and developed over more than thousand years ago and
no longer remain relevant in today's era.

CI is a practise that not only builds on top of the
principles of these few ancient somatic practises (gravity, sense of physical touch,
momentum) but makes it a social phenomena for human connection, something that is
no longer alive with yoga or martial arts in modern day to day life.

Sure there are yoga communities and martial art classes where people come
together and practise in groups but the disciple itself doesn't have any sense
of an open "jam" or playground where you test your skills and perception with
others in real time. Open Jams are undoubtedly a part of the CI practise and
not tacked-on on top as a glue for a missing social layer.

It is this improvisational aspect of CI, no drills or steps of poses followed in sequence,
that makes CI so beautifully new, deep and a constant mirror of our emotions
and of our world as we perceive it.

### Grounding and Trusting oneself

The more I practise CI the more I find myself trusting my body and bodily sensations
to guide me into ways of catching myself from falls, reading my partners
intentions and being aware of the general space around.
