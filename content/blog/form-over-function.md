Contemplating on what defines a products value and its worth?

For years, societies have inherently gauged a products value via the
functionality and utility it provides to its user.
Various aspects affects a products overall utility:
* **Usability**: In which situation does the product provide value?
* **Efficiency**: How best or easily does the product do the job it's intended for?
* **Durability**: How long does it last?
* **Convenience**: How optimal is it, in terms of weight, size, durability or
cost-effectiveness, energy use (both electrical and manual), maintainability,
among others.

Greater the functionality, the higher it's value.
No wonder our phones cost higher than a pocket watch (`1` function vs `n+` functions.)

However, advent of capitalism has trained our society to value aesthetics more than functionality.
"Form over Function" and "Sex Sells" are well known slogans of capitalism.
When we value form over function it gives rise to the concept of perceived
value, then it's a slippery slop of trying to outwit the consumer, creating
ever new trends and hype giving rise to unsustainable practises and
industries like fast fashion, fast food, fast cars, fast and cheap
constructions practises all of which leads to a detrimental effect on our
environment, our health and a never ending pursuit of gratification.

And that is frankly the root of all problems perpetuated with capitalism.
Capitalism needs an additional mechanism of checks and balances to re-align it's
incentives back to functionality at a higher priority or at least in balance with form.

Until then it's up to us to consciously choose function+form over only form at every turn.
