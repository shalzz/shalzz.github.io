Traveling, an act of going from place to place, can be such a simple yet magical experience.
You hop on a bus, a train or a airplane
and within a few hours you're transported to another microcosm on earth, with
it's own weather conditions, set of people, flora and fauna. With different places to see,
be in and do things.

We, as a species have always been travelers first and hunters and
gatherers later. It was this nomadic nature that allowed Homo Sapiens to
evolve and survive over not so fortunate Neanderthals.

Children naturally want to explore the world around them. Look at
everything in its rawness, taste it, smell it and play with it.

However, by the time we grow up we end up justify to ourselves that it's not so easy, 
there are rules and responsibilities that we must take up in order to survive in this
world and fit in. The more I grew up the more I started to think of traveling
as a privilege and a luxury.

It's this fear and scarcity based thinking and in-turn living,
accentuated by the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020 and 2021, that
I've been on a journey to transform into an abundance mindset ever since.

### What does traveling mean for You?

What does it mean to travel today? Is it just crossing a checklist of places and
countries to visit? Taking pictures of yourself at popular destinations as a
badge of accomplishment? Bragging about places you've been to at dinner
conversations? Or is there something more to it.

For me travelling is stepping out of one's comfort zone. A journey of
self-discovery that starts with an outward physical journey of exploration and
discovery. Of meeting new people and discovering new places. Travelling off
the beaten path and doing things that you always wanted to do but were
too scared to try. Facing your fears and challenges and not looking for
convenience everywhere you go. 

Travelling can bring up emotions and feelings that you might not have
addressed before in your daily life, it's easier to distract yourself in
a routine, finding excuses to keep on moving or blaming people/circumstances rather
than taking some time out to rest and introspect.

While travelling, you invariable face situations out of your control and
quickly learn to let go and accept things being out of your control
instead of worrying about it at every turn. It is because of these out of your
control situations, you get a chance to rest and face your emotions.

### Traveling as a local

You've most likely only been exposed to one way of travelling, i.e. "Traveling
as the Rich" that's the most common way of traveling that's talked about in
media, movies and in general.
However there's another approach that I like to describe as
"Traveling as a local"

Traveling as local means you don't see
yourself as separate from the place your traveling to, you don't try to
shield your self from the grey and not so pleasant areas of a place. You
embrace the people, the language, the food, the culture and the beauty
but also the issues of the area and it's inhabitants.

Some of the simplest ways of doing so is by staying at a place for a longer
period of time than your normal hit-and-run travels/weekend gateways,
letting you stay in guesthouses and hostels or even rent an apartment,
eating where the locals eat, talking to the locals and traveling as the locals
do.

Travelling by not planning every detail but giving yourself the time and space
to be in the flow, go where you feel and are called to.
Avoid the tourist traps and places, it's good to visit them *if* you
have the time but don't make them the main agenda of your travels.
Checkout the natural beauty of a place, hang out where the local hangout and experience
some of the local culture, their art, music, theater and museums.

This is how I was able to connect and resonate with a lot of places and
it's people as well as get a sense of the history and the economy of the place.

### Lifestyles

When traveling and living as a local, how do you sustain your lifestyle?
Many locals are able to live and stay at a place for years by working location-dependent jobs.
However, just because you are traveling as a local,
does it mean your only option is to work as a local?

There are various lifestyles that can lets you travel and work across the global,
known as location-independent jobs.
* Digital nomad or remote worker
* Gig worker
* Volunteer
* Travelling skilled worker
* Artist

It's up to you to find and create your perfect lifestyle, just know that
there's no one way or an only way to do it.

### Digital Nomadism

I have been living and working as a Digital Nomad for over two years now.

Digital Nomad means to work remotely via the internet and travel freely
across jurisdictions and geographies. Being a digital nomad, you get to
leverage things like [longitudinal arbitrage][2], [Flag][3] [Theory][4] and [Individual
Sovereignty][5].

For me it's been a progressive journey from having my first remote job, to
embracing the digital nomad lifestyle and then eventually building
companies and owning assets across jurisdictions. I have utilised multiple
tools on my path so far including Estonia's [E-Residency][6] and cryptocurrencies.

Not just having longitudinal but purchasing power arbitrage of earning in USD
and living spending in places with a much lower cost of living, like Thailand or India
and others based on [nomadlist][7].

There're various perks of working remotely:
* Working from caf√©'s with views and vibes
* Living in communities and communes where there's a stronger sense of
connection outside of work like Auroville, [The Bergerac Praxis Hub][8], startup hubs like Bangalore and
Lisbon, etc
* Having quarterly work retreats for team building, outings and putting faces
  to names within your team.

It's important to have a balance between remote work and teammate gatherings
when working remotely.

### My Experience

My first impetus for travelling was to get out of the feeling of suffocation and choking,
quite literally. Living and working remotely from Delhi, I developed a severe
allergic reaction to air pollution causing me to fall sick every few months with
a progressively decorating impact on my immunity and mental health.
I was stuck in a prison of my own making, further exaggerated by the Covid-19 induced lockdown. 

My first solo travelling trip was a huge step for me out
of my comfort zone and to start socializing despite my crippling social anxiety
and insecurities around being alone.

One of the great things of traveling is, knowing that I'll only ever be staying at a place
for a few weeks or months at best. This gave me the freedom to express myself
without fear of being judged and more so that judgement/opinion being held over me
for the rest of life, as what we usually think will happen when we are in school or
college.

Breaking my fear of not fitting in and always being seen as an
outcast or weird person was easier when I met people who were equally unique and
different and seemed to embrace their uniqueness, at least to a greater level
than me and anyone else I had met before, on my travels.

Once I had a taste and the confidence to travel
alone without any paranoia and limiting beliefs, my main motivation for
traveling became a quest of finding people like me who were also
on a spiritual journey of their own.

I went to places that had always called out to me the most but I was too scared
to go, not sure of the logistics, the people, culture, etc. 

I went to the Osho Meditation resort in Pune first, not knowing what I was
getting into. However that was a quite normalizing experience. Nothing
remarkable, controversial or  mindblowing happened but to just be in an
environment where people were freely talking and practising mediation and
spirituality, made it so much more easier for me to accept that part of me and
go deeper into my own practise.

Not long after completing my first heart-led trip that led to the expansion
and growth of my inner journey, I soon found what I was looking for. An
encounter with a group of people I couldn't have even imagined existing. The
level of connection and bond we ended up creating and having is now a lifelong bond.

We ended up traveling together to quite a few places but also stayed at one
location for more that seven months just because of those bunch of people that
became my friends, business partners, mentors and fellow travellers and
pilgrims on both outer and inner journeys.

### People

The most interesting part of traveling is the people you meet. Traveling,
meeting and talking to people really helps you widen your mindset, break out of
your comfort zone and develop social and conversational skills.

All in a low stakes environment, if you mess up there's no risk of "destroying your
reputation", which is an irrational fear, that at least I had growing up.
Of saying something that is not socially accepted or you're not good at and
then regret being made fun of something because of something you said
casually. That's the great thing about traveling, you're always temporal in
space, naturally making you de-attached to places, people and expectations.

While travelling you meet people of all personality types and more so your
perception/opinion of certain people you've always held in your mind. You
certainly need to have an open mindset and heart for meeting new people and
having conversations, but the more you do so, the more you realise your
perceptions are just that, perceptions.

Perceptions are always away from the reality. We perceive the reality based
on your capacity to sense the environment.
It's important to acknowledge that limitation and be willing to continuously
widen your perception without holding any judgements.
