Traveling, the act of going from place to place, always seemed to me like a privilege or a luxury.

Such a simple yet magical experience it can be. You hop on a bus, a train or a airplane
and within a few hours you're transported to another microcosm on earth, with
it's own weather conditions, set of people, flora and fauna, with places to see and
be and things to do.

We, as a species have always been travelers first and hunters and
gatherers later. It was this nomadic nature that allowed Homo Sapiens to
evolve and survive over not so fortunate Neanderthals.

As a child we all naturally want to explore the world around us. Look at
everything in its rawness, taste it, smell it and play with literally
anything.

However, by the time we grow up we end up justify to ourselves that it's not so easy, 
there are rules and responsibilities that we must take up in order to survive in this
world and fit in.

It's this fear and scarcity based thinking and in-turn living,
accentuated by the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020 and 2021, that
I've been on a journey to transform into an abundance mindset ever since.

### What does traveling mean for You?

What does it mean to travel today? Is it just crossing a checklist of places and
countries to visit? Taking pictures of yourself at popular destinations as a
badge of accomplishment? Bragging about places you've been to at dinner
conversations? Or is there something more to it.

For me travelling is stepping out of one's comfort zone. A journey of
self-discovery that starts with an outward physical journey of exploration and
discovery. Of meeting new people and discovering new places. Travelling off
the beaten path and doing things that you always wanted to do but were
too scared to try. Facing your fears and challenges and not looking for
convenience everywhere you go. 

Travelling can bring up emotions and feelings that you might not have
addressed before in your daily life, it's easier to distract yourself in
a routine, finding excuses to keep on moving or blaming people/circumstances rather
than taking some time out to rest and introspect.

While travelling, you invariable face situations out of your control and
quickly learn to let go and accept things being out of your control
instead of worrying about it at every turn. It is because of these out of your
control situations you get a chance to rest and face your emotions.

### Traveling as a local

Okay, so you want to travel, but how do you start?

You've most likely only been exposed to one way of travelling, i.e. "Traveling
as the Rich" that's the most common way of traveling that's talked about in
media, movies and in general.
However there's another approach that I like to describe as
"Traveling as a local"

Traveling as local means you don't see
yourself as separate from the place your traveling to, you don't try to
shield your self from the grey and not so pleasant areas of a place. You
embrace the people, the language, the food, the culture and the beauty
but also the issues of the area and it's inhabitants.

Some of the simplest ways of doing so is by staying at a place for a longer
period of time than your normal hit-and-run travels/weekend gateways,
letting you stay in guesthouses and hostels or even rent an apartment,
eating where the locals eat, talking to the locals and traveling as the locals
do.

Avoid the tourist trap and touristy places, it's good to visit them *if* you
have the time but don't make them the main agenda of your travels. Checkout the
natural beauty of a place, hang out where the local hangout and experience
some of the local culture (their art, music, theater and museums).

This is how I was able to connect and resonate with a lot of places and it's people.
Get a sense of the history and the economy of a place.

### Lifestyle

If you're traveling and living as a local, how do you sustain your lifestyle?
Many locals are able to live and stay at a place for years since they work
there.
However, just because you are traveling as a local, does it mean you also need to work as a local?

You can certainly chose to, if you wish, however that's not the only option. 

There are various lifestyles that can let you travel as a local. Digital
nomad, gig worker, volunteer, travelling skilled worker, artist.

Travelling by not planning but rather being in the flow. 
They live life as raw as possible With minimal convenience.

No sugar courting or only look at one side/happy or beautiful side
They embrace and face the truth and duality
Or we should

### Experience

Booking a cab in advance while still walking
Then catching the auto before he reaches the location

### Solo traveling

TK;
The best way to do so and experience the world as a reflection of your own
inner world, I find it is much more *easier* if you're traveling solo.
Eventually when you get a hang of solo travelling, you find other solo
travellers along the way that you can travel with without getting distracted from your
your own experiences. 

### People

The most interesting part of traveling is the people you meet. Traveling,
meeting and talking to people really helps you widen your mindset, break out of
your comfort zone and develop social and conversational skills.

All in a low stakes environment, if you mess up there's no risk of "destroying your
reputation", which is an irrational fear, that at least I had growing up.
Of saying something that is not socially accepted or you're not good at and
then regret being made fun of something because of something you said
casually. That's the great thing about traveling, you're always temporal in
space, naturally making you de-attached to places, people and expectations.

While travelling you meet people of all personality types and more so your
perception/opinion of certain people you've always held in your mind. You
certainly need to have an open mindset and heart for meeting new people and
having conversations, but the more you do so, the more you realise your
perceptions are just that, perceptions.

Perceptions are always away from the reality. We perceive the reality based
on your capacity to sense the environment.
It's important to acknowledge that limitation and be willing to continuously
widen your perception without holding any judgements.
