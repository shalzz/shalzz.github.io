## Introduction

Domain Name System ([DNS][9]) is a protocol for naming servers on the internet that host
websites. Since computers on the internet are recognizable to each other 
only by their IP addresses which is a unique numerical label, for convenience
every website uses a fairly recognizable domain name (www.ietf.org) to
point users to their own servers (4.31.198.44) hosting the website by the means
of the DNS system, where a DNS server provides the mapping between the domain
name and the server IP address.

However the current architecture of DNS servers and domain name issuers is highly 
centralized and controlled by a few organizations and corporations of the world.

## The Dark Underbelly

Having such a critical part of the Internet infrastructure be a central point
of failure can have devastating effects and is against the founding principles
of the internet envisioned by its creators.

There have been various instances where websites and user information has been 
compromised by hijacked DNS systems and domain names [^fn-1] as well as large scale
internet outages due to design flaws being exploited in the DNS protocol [^fn-2].

Much of the hierarchy and centralization of the DNS system stems from the need to
have a trusted party between domain/website owners and users, mainly TLD root domain
owners (e.g. ICANN for .com) who verify the ownership of domain names and make sure
only authorized personal can update DNS records of a website.

For a long time there hasn't been a technically better system available that wouldn't
require trusting a third party as a design requirement. That is until now…

## Handshake

With the advent of blockchain and it's echoing principles of the early internet
and cypherpunk, it provides a novel socio-economic-cryptographic solution for avoiding
the need to require placing trust in middlemen in inherently peer-to-peer systems.

The [Handshake network][3] is a decentralized, permissionless naming protocol
backed by a blockchain designed to solve the trusted 3rd party
problem with root DNS naming zones (TLD's) and Certificate Authorities.

If you are a domain owner wanting to use the Handshake network, owning a
Handshake name involves quite a few steps
for which there are already a lot of good resources available on the internet
(see for example [namebase.io][13]).
So, in this post we are going to focus on how you can use Handshake as an end user
and start relying on handshake for resolving traditional and handshake names.

## Setup

The Handshake networks is made up of nodes acting as peers and exchanging messages
with every other node in the network. To participate in the network you need to
run the node software yourself on a machine or server.

The Handshake org provides open source software that is
built according to the Handshake protocol spec and has mainly two kinds of nodes:

* Full node: [hsd][4]
* Light node: [hnsd][5]

We are gonna setup the full node `hsd` daemon as our DNS resolver. 
Since it's a full node we are gonna need to maintain the full chain state which
can easily take multiple gigabytes (around 3-4 GB) of storage along with a 24×7 running system
on your home network. The recommended hardware for this is:

* A Raspberry Pi or any other single board computer with at least 2 GB of Ram running a Linux OS
* A portable/external HDD/SDD with least a 500GB storage space.

If you'd rather not run the full node or don't have a device with sufficient storage
space you can setup a light node instead which will only take up a few megabytes
of storage instead of gigabytes. For brevity I'm only gonna discuss setting up
the full node here.

Once you have the required hardware we can start setting up the software. I'd
recommend using docker images to avoid dependency hell.

You can build your own docker image from the [hsd][4] repo or use a pre-built
one I have over at docker hub at [shalzz/hsd][7].

```
docker pull shalzz/hsd
```

Add a volume mapping a folder on your external hdd to `/root/.hsd` and expose the
required ports according to the command line
`hsd --ns-host 0.0.0.0 --ns-port 5300 --rs-host 0.0.0.0 --rs-port 53`

Here is the same thing as a `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  hsd:
    container_name: hsd
    image: hsd:2.2.0-a1409dc4
    volumes:
      - '/media/sda1/hsd-data:/root/.hsd'
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "5300:5300/udp"
      - "5300:5300/tcp"
    command:
      - 'hsd'
      - '--ns-host'
      - '0.0.0.0'
      - '--ns-port'
      - '5300'
      - '--rs-host'
      - '0.0.0.0'
      - '--rs-port'
      - '53'
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Once you have the hsd daemon running you can override the DNS server settings for either your
individual devices on your home network
(desktop, Smart TV) but it's better and easier to override the DNS server settings in
your Wi-Fi router.

It's recommended to setup a static IP/lease to your local server to prevent
breakage. Here's a guide to do so with the [OpenWrt][8] firmware.

## Test

To make sure everything is working as expected you can query your DNS server specifically
by its IP address. For e.g. if the device your hosting the server on has the IP
address `192.168.1.224` on your home network, you can query it for a name via the
`dig` program

```
$ dig @192.168.1.224 example.com

; <<>> DiG 9.16.10 <<>> @192.168.1.224 example.com

```

If the status here is `NOERROR` and you see any entries under the ANSWER Section,
you have successfully setup your own DNS server.

An additional benefit of using handshake network here is now in addition to traditional
domain names you can resolve handshake names as well. Try visiting or resolving `http://welcome.nb./`

## Adguard

Since you've come this far you might as well setup an Adblocking server as well
that is using your `hsd` DNS server as an upstream.

There are two good options for adblocking self-hosting server
* [Pihole][10]
* [Adguard][11]

I find Adguard to be much more reliable and that is what I use personally.
If you decide to go ahead with Adguard they already have great documentation
to get up and running with [docker][12].

Once you have Adguard running in addition to `hsd` you can setup Adguard to use
`hsd` as an upstream server in the DNS settings page of Adguard.
Make sure you change the port number you used earlier for `hsd` from `53` to
something else since there can only be one process listening on a port as here
`adguard` acts as a filter between clients and the actual DNS resolver.

For e.g. if your device IP address is `192.168.1.224` and the port of `hsd` is `54`
use `tcp://192.168.1.224:54` as an upstream server address for both
`Upstream DNS servers` and `Bootstrap DNS servers`

Here is the complete `docker-compose.yaml` file for setting up both `hsd` and `adguard`.
Customize for your setup.
