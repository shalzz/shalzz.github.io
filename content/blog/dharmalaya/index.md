[Dharmalaya][0] is 6-acre eco-campus located near a village in Bir, Himachal
Pradesh. The institute is intentioned as an alternate school with their main
focus being on contemplative arts and teachings of the traditional practises
of natural building and agriculture in-addition to now integrating that with
permaculture principles.

<!-- more -->

I visited the institute for a 3-month permaculture course led by an Australian
Permaculture teacher Robyn Hewson. The course itself was quite helpful and
enriching however here I will be focusing on sharing my experience with the
community and how it was staying within the campus of Dharmalaya for an
extended period of time.

### Community

Never before have I been in a community so distraught, fractured and
scattered.  So many lost and jaded humans, trying to find a sense of purpose,
respect and self-worth by trying to help others and building a "better world".
However it all comes from a place of a moral high-ground, a sense of lack and
neediness. Rather instead an overflowing of abundance and love.

The campus is completely isolated, with a lack of collaboration with the
outside world.  The incentives for people staying in and volunteering
long-term are also misaligned. With them having to pay for their lodging and
food while working on the garden beds, providing labour for the natural build
constructions or just doing logistics around the workshops, setting up for the
new people coming in and administering the daily needs and chores of the
community.

There are some elements to the community that are inspiring, especially how
they have the local native villagers integrated and a part of the workings of
Dharmalaya. All of them work full time as staff; helping out with the
maintenance of the buildings with regular plastering work, tending to the
garden beds, planting and growing annuals, growing and caring after many of
the native trees within the land, cooking 3 meals a day in the Kitchen. 

Some of the Buddhist cultural influences from the town of Bir, can be seen and
felt within the campus and the way the teachings here are imparted. Like the
"Short Times, Many Times" practise by Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche of meditating
for even just 2 minutes before starting every circle.

### Spiritual Materialism 

One of the founder of Dharmalaya, Mai-Linh seems to be a spiritual healer of
sorts, having practised Buddhist philosophy and teachings, she has made a
career out of it.

Undoubtedly, she held a few online sessions with us while I was there, talking
and sharing a Buddhist technique of connecting with the five elements.
Many of these teachings in various spiritual and traditional
lineages are secret and are only passed down when the disciple is ready.
Additionally, they are not taught by just anyone and most definitely not
in a generalised and abstract way.

Unsurprisingly it caused more confusion than help anyone while we were
there. For me it was highly intellectualized and just stories created around
the five elements, no matter how many times she told us to "just experience
it" and not think.

This really made me think of "Spiritual Materialism" as popularized by Chogyam
Trungpa Rinpoche as a trick of the ego. Using the nature, elements and
eventually spiritually as a way of enhancing our ego, not really coming
any closer to truth and reality.

A glimpse of her approach can be inferred from this text she shared with us after
many people requested more information to understand the teachings.

### Natural Building and Didi Contractor

[Didi Contractor][1] was a self-taught German-American architect known for her
natural building designs, many of which are seen in the living spaces at
Dharmalaya.

As soon as you enter the campus and spend some time in the Main Building,
you'll see her portrait hanging on a wall, adorned with flowers and incense. A
book written on her life by one of her apprentices is visibly kept in a common
space for anyone to read and eventually buy a copy for themselves; there are
always a few in stock at Dharmalaya.

There's a fanaticism around Didi Contractor at Dharmalaya, as if she were a
pioneer or the greatest architect in the world. Yet, she primarily brought
back traditional building methods that had been used in India for generations
but had lost their appeal due to Western cultural influences.

This isn't surprising in India, where a foreigner is often given more respect
and value than an Indian in their own land for the same ideas. It's no wonder
then that a Westerner had to start preaching about the values of natural
buildings for people to start paying attention. Of course, she could explain
the benefits in English, combining them with modern architecture principles
and Vastu Shastra—the ancient science of architecture from Hindu Vedic Texts.

Imagine an amateur self-taught Indian telling you to build your house with mud
and the often considered superstitious science of Vastu—such a suggestion might
be dismissed outright!

The fanaticism hasn't stopped after she passed away, though. Even today, her
quotes like "The best building is no building" are chanted and taken too
literally by budding architects and professionals.

If you happen to be part of a Natural Design and Contemplative Architecture
course at Dharmalaya, know that it's quite unlikely you will get to build a
structure or a building at the site unless it's heavily influenced by Didi's
previous designs. One of the reasons you'll hear for this is that the largest
flat patch of land, the camp grounds, has an energy of its own. It's a
community space where people often come together to play, chat, and
contemplate. Building anything there, they say, would only dissipate the
energy and in no way enhance or preserve its essence.

Being a Natural Building or Didi Contractor fanatic can't be the worst thing,
right? Well, the thing about fanaticism is that it often appeals to those who
are less grounded. In my conversations with one of the local villagers who has
been working at Dharmalaya for over 10 years, I came across a surprising
story. Hariyali Didi, who has built multiple mud houses and learned the
methods from her grandfathers, says she herself has built her most recent
house with cement and burnt bricks.

In her own words:

> "Cement buildings are all the trend now." -- Hariyali Devi

So, Dharmalaya and all its fanaticism haven't done much good if the people
working there themselves don't see and understand the benefits of Natural
Buildings, no matter what the prevailing cultural trend is.

### Founders

Mark Moore and Mai-Linh are the two main co-founders of Dharmalaya. However,
they've both stepped back from their roles in stewarding the institute and no
longer stay at the campus to actively grow and thrive with the community.

I see this in many communities: once led purely by the founders' vision and
drive, they're left in a void and chaos, having to reorganize and self-govern
without the continued guidance and vision of the founding members, whether the
founders step back voluntarily or due to other circumstances.

What's often overlooked by these communities and their founders is this path
of natural succession. How does a community grow and evolve with a completely
or even a partially non-overlapping shift of community members? Often, there's
no governance system in place. While hierarchy is often the most optimal and
efficient organizational structure in human society at a small scale, many
altruistic and well-intentioned founders see it as a point of failure, lacking
redundancy.

However, going straight from a hierarchy to a flat organizational model simply
**does not** work. I don't see myself visiting Dharmalaya again, but I do
know how it feels to be in a dysfunctional community now.
