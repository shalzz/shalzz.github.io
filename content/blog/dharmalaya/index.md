[Dharmalaya][0] is 6-acres eco-campus located near a Village in Bir, Himachal Pradesh.
The institute is intentioned as an alternate school with their main focus being
on teaching while keeping alive the traditional practises of natural
building and agriculture in-addition to now integrating that with permaculture principles.

### Community

Never before have I been in a community so distraught, fractured and scattered.
So many lost and jaded humans, trying to find a sense of purpose, respect and
self-worth by trying to help others and building a "better world".
However it all comes from a place of a moral high-ground and a sense of
lacking and neediness rather than an overflowing of abundance and love.

The campus is completely isolated with there being a lack of collaboration
with the outside world. 
The incentives for people staying in and volunteering for a long-term are also
misaligned. With them having to pay for their lodging and food while working
on the garden beds, providing labour for the natural build constructions but
mostly just doing logistics around the workshops, setting up for the new
people coming in and administering the daily needs and chores of the
community.

There are some elements to the community that are inspiring, especially how
they have the local native villagers integrated and a part of the workings of
Dharmalaya. All of them work full time as staff; helping out with the
maintainace of the buildings with regular plastering work, tending to the
garden beds, planting and growing annuals, growing and caring after many of
the native trees within the land, cooking 3 meals a day in the Kitchen. 

Some of the Buddhist cultural influences from the town of Bir, can be seen and felt
within the campus and the way the teachings here are imparted. Like the "Short
times, Many times" practise by Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche of meditating for even
just 2 minutes before starting every circle.

### Spiritual Materialism 

One of the founder of Dharmalaya Mai-Linh herself seems to be a spiritual healer
of sorts, having practised and learned a lot of the Buddhist philosophy and
teachings, she has made a career out of it.
Undoubted she had a few sessions with us while I was there, talking and
sharing a Buddhist technique of connecting with the five elements.
There's a reason many of these teaching in many spiritual and traditional 
lineages are secret and are only passed down when the disciple is ready.
Mostly because they cannot be taught by anyone and most definetly not in a
generalised and abstract way which is exactly how Mi-Ling decided to share it
with us.
Not surprisingly it caused more confusion than help anyone while we
were there. Intellectualising and creating stories from the teachings cannot
really help anyone experience the reality and truth, not matter how many times
she told us to "just experience it" and not think about it, which really is
the essence of "Spiritual Materialism" as popularized by Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche
as a trick of the ego and ours is the time where we are more prone
to fall prey to it.

A glimpse of her approach can inferred from this text she shared with us after
many people requested more information to understand the teachings.

### Natural Building and Didi Contractor

[Didi Contractor][1] is a self-taught German-American Architect who designed many
of the living spaces at Dharmalaya.

As soon as you enter the campus and spend some time in the Main building,
you'll see her portrait photo hanging on a wall, adorned with flowers and incense. 
There's a book written on her life by one of her apprentices that's
visibly kept in a common space for anyone to read and eventually buy a copy for
themselves, of which there's always a few in stock at Dharmalaya.

There's a fanaticism around Didi Contractor in Dharmalaya, as if she was a pioneer or the
greatest architect of the world. All she did was bring back traditional
building methods that had been used in India since generations but had lost its
appeal because of western culture influences.

Which is not surprising in India, where a foreigner is given more respect and
value more than an Indian in his own land for the same ideas. It's no wonder
then that a western had to start preaching about the values of natural buildings 
for people to start paying attention. Of course she could explain the benefits in
English, combine them with modern architecture principles and Vastu Shastra - 
the ancient science of architecture from Hindu Vedic Texts.

Imagine an amateur self-taught Indian telling you to build your house
with mud and the superstitious science of Vastu, such blasphemy!

The fanaticism hasn't stop after she pass away though. 
Even today her quotes like "The best building is no building" are chanted
and taken too literally by budding architect interns and professionals.

If you happen to be a part of Natural Design and Contemplative Architecture
course at Dharmalaya, know that it is quite unlikely you will get to build
a structure or a building at the site, unless it heavily influenced by Didi's 
previous designs. One of the reasons you'll hear for this, the largest flat
patch of the land which is the camp grounds, has an energy of it's own. It's a
community space where people often come together to play, chat and contemplate.
Building anything over there will only dissipate the energy and in no way
ever be able to enhance or preserve the essence of it.

Being an Natural Building or Didi Contractor fanatic can't be the worst thing
right? Well, the thing about fanaticism is that only non-grounded people
fall for it. In my conversations with one of the local villagers who has been
working at Dharmalaya for over 10 years I came across a surprising story.
Hariyali Didi, who has built multiple mud houses and has learned it from her
grandfathers, says she herself has built her most recent house with cement and
burnt bricks.

In her own words:
> "Cement buildings are all the trend now" -- Hariyali Devi

And so Dharamalaya and all it's fanaticism hasn't done much good if the people
working there themselves don't see and understand the benefits of Natural
Buildings, no matter what the prevailing cultural trend is.
 
### Permaculture

I visited the institute for a 3-months permaculture course led by an
Australian Permaculture teacher Robyn Hewson.
