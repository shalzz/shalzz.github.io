[Dharmalaya][0] is 6-acre eco-campus located near a Village in Bir, Himachal
Pradesh. The institute is intentioned as an alternate school with their main
focus being on contemplative arts and teachings of the traditional practises of
natural building and agriculture in-addition to now integrating that with
permaculture principles.

<!-- more -->

I visited the institute for a 3-month permaculture course led by an
Australian Permaculture teacher Robyn Hewson. The course itself was quite
helpful and enriching however here I will be focusing on sharing my experience with
the community and how it was staying within the campus of Dharmalaya for an
extended period of time.

### Community

Never before have I been in a community so distraught, fractured and scattered.
So many lost and jaded humans, trying to find a sense of purpose, respect and
self-worth by trying to help others and building a "better world".
However it all comes from a place of a moral high-ground, a sense of
lack and neediness. Rather instead an overflowing of abundance and love.

The campus is completely isolated, with a lack of collaboration
with the outside world. 
The incentives for people staying in and volunteering long-term are also
misaligned. With them having to pay for their lodging and food while working
on the garden beds, providing labour for the natural build constructions
or just doing logistics around the workshops, setting up for the new
people coming in and administering the daily needs and chores of the
community.

There are some elements to the community that are inspiring, especially how
they have the local native villagers integrated and a part of the workings of
Dharmalaya. All of them work full time as staff; helping out with the
maintenance of the buildings with regular plastering work, tending to the
garden beds, planting and growing annuals, growing and caring after many of
the native trees within the land, cooking 3 meals a day in the Kitchen. 

Some of the Buddhist cultural influences from the town of Bir, can be seen and felt
within the campus and the way the teachings here are imparted. Like the "Short
Times, Many Times" practise by Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche of meditating for even
just 2 minutes before starting every circle.

### Spiritual Materialism 

One of the founder of Dharmalaya, Mai-Linh seems to be a spiritual healer
of sorts, having practised Buddhist philosophy and teachings,
she has made a career out of it.

Undoubtedly, she held a few online sessions with us while I was there, talking and
sharing a Buddhist technique of connecting with the five elements.
There's a reason many of these teaching in many spiritual and traditional 
lineages are secret and are only passed down when the disciple is ready.
Additionally because they cannot be taught by anyone and most definitely not in a
generalised and abstract way which is exactly how Mai-Linh decided to share it
with us.

Not surprisingly it caused more confusion than help anyone while we
were there. Intellectualising and creating stories from the teachings cannot
really help anyone experience the reality and truth, not matter how many times
she told us to "just experience it" and not think about it, which really is
the essence of "Spiritual Materialism" as popularized by Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche
as a trick of the ego and ours is the time where we are more prone
to fall prey to it.

A glimpse of her approach can inferred from this text she shared with us after
many people requested more information to understand the teachings.

### Natural Building and Didi Contractor

[Didi Contractor][1] is a self-taught German-American Architect who designed many
of the living spaces at Dharmalaya.

As soon as you enter the campus and spend some time in the Main building,
you'll see her portrait photo hanging on a wall, adorned with flowers and incense. 
There's a book written on her life by one of her apprentices that's
visibly kept in a common space for anyone to read and eventually buy a copy for
themselves, of which there's always a few in stock at Dharmalaya.

There's a fanaticism around Didi Contractor in Dharmalaya, as if she was a pioneer or the
greatest architect of the world. All she did was bring back traditional
building methods that had been used in India since generations but had lost its
appeal because of western culture influences.

Which is not surprising in India, where a foreigner is given more respect and
value more than an Indian in his own land for the same ideas. It's no wonder
then that a western had to start preaching about the values of natural buildings 
for people to start paying attention. Of course she could explain the benefits in
English, combine them with modern architecture principles and Vastu Shastra - 
the ancient science of architecture from Hindu Vedic Texts.

Imagine an amateur self-taught Indian telling you to build your house
with mud and the superstitious science of Vastu, such blasphemy!

The fanaticism hasn't stop after she pass away though. 
Even today her quotes like "The best building is no building" are chanted
and taken too literally by budding architect interns and professionals.

If you happen to be a part of Natural Design and Contemplative Architecture
course at Dharmalaya, know that it is quite unlikely you will get to build
a structure or a building at the site, unless it heavily influenced by Didi's 
previous designs. One of the reasons you'll hear for this, the largest flat
patch of the land which is the camp grounds, has an energy of it's own. It's a
community space where people often come together to play, chat and contemplate.
Building anything over there will only dissipate the energy and in no way
ever be able to enhance or preserve the essence of it.

Being an Natural Building or Didi Contractor fanatic can't be the worst thing
right? Well, the thing about fanaticism is that only non-grounded people
fall for it. In my conversations with one of the local villagers who has been
working at Dharmalaya for over 10 years I came across a surprising story.
Hariyali Didi, who has built multiple mud houses and has learned it from her
grandfathers, says she herself has built her most recent house with cement and
burnt bricks.

In her own words:
> "Cement buildings are all the trend now" -- Hariyali Devi

And so Dharmalaya and all it's fanaticism hasn't done much good if the people
working there themselves don't see and understand the benefits of Natural
Buildings, no matter what the prevailing cultural trend is.
 
### Founders

Mark Moore and Mai-Linh are the main two co-founders of Dharmalaya however now
they both have stepped back from their role of stewarding the
institute and no longer stay at the campus or growing and thriving with and
in the community.

I see this in many communities where the communities once led purely by the
vision and drive of the founders is left in a void and chaos of having to
re-organise and self-govern themselves without the continued guidance and
vision of the founding members, whether the founder step-back voluntary or
non-voluntary by natural succession.

Something that is overlooked by these communities and their founders is indeed
this path of natural succession. How does a community grow and evolve with
a completely or even a partially non-overlapping shift of community members.
Often there is no governance system put in place, hierarchy is the most
optimal and efficient organisational structure in the human society at low
scale and many altruistic and well-intentioned founders see it as a
point of failure with no-redundancy.

However going straight from a hierarchy to a flat organisational model
**does not** work. We see this clearly time and again in communities and societies
like Auroville, Sri Aurobindo Ashram, OSHO International Resort, in Nation
States and countries with the highest head, dead or replaced
and the whole culture of the state is forced to change or there is civil war
,distress, military coups and discord.

I don't see myself visiting Dharmalay again but I know now how it feels to be
in a dysfunctional community.
