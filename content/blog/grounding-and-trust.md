While attending a CI workshop in Goa, at a wonderful space under a huge Banyan
Tree with sunlight shimmering through it's leaves, after finishing a set of
partner exercises we sat down in a circle to share our experiences and
feelings. Two other participants began the sharing with how they where able
to trust each other letting them both share weight, lift and fly each other
easily.

Having sensed this theme of trust issues within the group, I chimed in with my
perspective on trust. I shared that indeed it is not only about trusting the
other but more so of trusting oneself, to be able to sense, perceive and catch
myself in a fall. Being comfortable in different orientations and knowing your
center of gravity. That in turn lets you work within your limits but also take
risks leading to expansion of your capabilities and limits.

The facilitator resonated with me by adding that indeed trust is not something
that you just give, it comes from within, with awareness of your presence and
body sensations leading to an even greater connection and perception of the
other, navigating tricky spaces, communicating and negotiating each others
limits and boundaries.

The more I practise CI the more I find myself trusting my body and its
sensations to guide me into ways of catching myself from falls, having more
spacial awareness, acknowledging my emotions and reading others intentions. 

Essentially being comfortable handling new, unknown and challenging situations.
