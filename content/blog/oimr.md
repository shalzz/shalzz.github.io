The OSHO International Mediation Resort (OIMR) in Pune is a unique resort which
offers not only the traditional relaxation services of a luxury resort, Basho
Spa, swimming pool, sauna, Jacuzzi, etc. But also, true to it's name, offers more
internal ways of relaxation. The various meditation techniques developed by
OSHO himself for the modern man, that are held throughout the day and
facilitated by many in-resident sannyasins or volunteer sannyasins.

If you manage to stay at the resort for more than a week though, you'll
quickly see the whole place is stuck in a pattern of some sorts, across it's
various aspects, seeping right down to it's essential core. It's starts from their
mundane weekly schedule of daily meditations, to the food options available at
their Zorba the Buddha restaurant.

Of course this affinity for routine and pattern is reflected by the people
living here or visiting the place often.
You'll find the same people visiting the resort every year,
sticking to the same meditation techniques from the 
few options, even down to the way people dance at the evening meeting
meditation. Everyone has their own pattern of dancing that they knowingly
repeat every time, no matter the music, their emotions or the circumstances. 

A routine or a repeating structure can indeed be useful in certain situations
though. For me, travelling and being in the flow continuously can
lead to a certain exhaustion where I don't have a chance to settle down, collect
my thoughts and then turn off my active mind enough to integrate and embody my
experiences.

Staying at the OIMR for a month as part of their Work-as-Meditation program
gave me just that exact chance. Having a set schedule laid out for me, I didn't
have to continuously tap into how I'm feeling or flowing in order to be able
to make any decisions. Letting others, or the existence through others, make the
decisions for me on where to flow.

Letting go at a deeper level and just being aware of my resistances, of them being 
intellectual or actually existential?

With no goals or destination in my mind, coupled with a few meditations I was
doing everyday, I was able to completely drop into how I was feeling at the
body-sensations level. Being aware of my emotions, feeling and letting go
of them one by one.

Learning and practising Qi Gong and Tai Chi taught at OIMR by Raj was also
surprisingly quite beneficial in pushing grounding energies throughout my body
more consciously, combining physical and psychic effort.

The few odd jobs I did at the resort, did indeed help me in growing out of my
own cocoon of feelings and energy dynamics and instead being more aware and
sensitive of other peoples energy fields. As well as how much of an effect I
can have on them, especially through my words, in addition to my actions.

Of course OSHO's words through his video talks and books throughout my stay,
helped my get an intellectual understanding of what is happening to me as
well.

Not surprisingly, in all the communities and communes I have visited so
far, this one as well is but just a shadow of what it used to be under the
leadership and aliveness of a visionary. Stuck perpetually in a vegetative
state, left as it is by its founder.
