## Overview

Estonia has a robust online and digital platform for availing all government
services and accessing gov website by virtue of a digital ID card that is issued to every
citizen.

Estonia's [E-residency][1] program is an extension of that infrastructure that lets
any non-citizen of Estonia get access to their digital
government services from anywhere across the globe.
This includes being able to incorporate and run a
business, file taxes, etc completely online and remotely.

Here I describe how my experience of being an e-resident and running an online
business has been.

## Getting the E-residency card

To become an e-resident, actually [applying][2] to the e-residency program is quite straightforward and a
completely online process. You fill up the form and provide a statement of
purpose with your current/future business model or services you provide.
With me being an android developer and having a few apps on the play store,
I attached a screenshot of my Play Store Developer page, just to make it
easier for them.

Applications for e-residency are usually quite easily accepted especially if your
business or service is inherently digital, online and location
independent.

Once your application is accepted, you'll receive an email with details on how
to collect your ID card from the nearest collection point. Most likely it's the
Estonian embassy that's near to you. Once there, they'll verify your
passport and scan your fingerprints for their records. You should have
now gotten a box on the way out which contains the e-residency ID card, USB card reader,
the cards secret PIN and PIN2 and a few informational documents.

## Using the digital-ID card

Once you have your digital/eID smart card in hand, you'll require setting up
some software in order to use it. 

### Web eID
To log in to websites we need to install the "Web eID" extension:
* [Google Chrome extension][6]
* [Firefox extension][5]

For more detail and extensions for other browsers see their official website
[here][4].

### DigiDoc

To be able to sign and read encrypted documents we need to download the
"DigiDoc" desktop application. The download link for your OS can be found [here][4].

If you're on Linux, you need to follow a few additional setup instructions found
[here][7].

### Smart-ID

Using the smart card ID every time for logging in to your service provider or bank
website can quickly get cumbersome. For quick and simple access to
websites with eID login I recommend setting up and using [Smart-ID](https://www.smart-id.com/).

## Choosing a Service Provider

You're now set to be able to sing and carry out all business legal operations 
yourself including filing incorporation document, tax reports, annual
report, etc.

However, you'll rarely want to or have the time/knowledge to do so yourself, 
this is where Estonia's service
provider [marketplace][3] comes in. Here you can hire/enter into a contract
with professional service providers that handle your company's incorporation,
having a legally required contract-person in Estonia and filing your tax/annual report
among others.

Check out the [marketplace][3] to select the ones that fit your requirements.

I've personally used and talked with [Xolo][8] and [1Office][9], so I'll be sharing
my review and feedback of using their services.

### Xolo

[Xolo's][8] great in a number of ways:

* Has predictable monthly pricing.
* Covers any reasonable extra services you might need within the monthly price.
* Has excellent FAQ documentation
* Quick and responsive support
* Assists with setting up an interview for an Estonian Bank account via LHV
* Nice and slick dashboard with multiple integrations with Wise, Stripe, etc.

However, they have a quite strict scope of the type of businesses/services they
can accept and service. It's mostly so they can automate and scale their
services while keeping the operational overhead low. It's how they manage
to keep their prices relatively low.

This means, for example, they don't accept businesses
who sell physical goods or services including drop-shipping and e-commerce sites.
Also, they only support Wise or LHV for business banking.

### 1Office

[1Office][9] on the other hand, is more like a traditional accountant/auditing
firm and provide services to any legal business under the sun. 

Some benefits I found:
* Can mix and match services you explicitly require.
* Supports e-commerce and drop-shipping businesses with a specific plan to get
  up and running with Shopify Pro
* Supports any business banking partner.
* Has integrations with "My Money" for business banking with Estonian IBAN
  (which I think is the only online payment aggregator that does so)
* Supports e-residency across multiple countries and can handle accounting for
  any/all of them.

The major downsides I found was they are a bit more expensive and have
a more bespoke payment plan
(they list payment plans on their site however when contacting their sales team,
they ask for your requirements and end up quoting a completely custom payment plan and
tier) and charge individually for every service besides the basics.

## Closing
