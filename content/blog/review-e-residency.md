## Getting the E-residency card

Actually applying to the e-residency program is quite straightforward and a
completely online process. You fill up the form and provide a statement of
purpose and your current/future business model or services you provide.
I attached a screenshot of my Play Store Developer page, just to make it
easier for them.

Applications for e-residency are usually easily accepted especially if your
business or service is inherently digital, online and location
independent.

Once your application is accepted, you'll receive an email with detail on how
to collect your ID card from the nearest collection point. Usually it's the
Estonian embassy that you'll have to visit. Once there, they'll verify your
passport and scan your fingerprints for their records. You should now have
gotten a box in return which contains the e-residency ID card, USB card reader,
the cards secret PIN and PIN2 and a few informational documents.
