### Martial Arts and reading intent

This ties into the embodied aspect of Martial Arts as well. The more one is
empty of emotions, of fear, doubt and uncertainty the more one is grounded and
rooted. Hence it becomes ever so spontaneous to visualize and read not only
your own physical trajectory in space-time but with practise the opponents
moves, actions and eventually their subtle intentions.

###  Why I got into contact improvisation

My first introduction to dance was in middle school where we were introduced
to Indian classical dance. We were taught choreographed steps to learn,
memorize and repeat. Not so different from how everything else is taught in
the Indian education system.

I was never really drawn to the art form of dancing, the choreographed,
repeating patterns of steps shrieked me away from finding any joy in the act
of dancing. I always felt like being judged and objectified based purely on
how good I and my dance moves looked.

Even Latin-American partner dances with their rules and structures but a few
degrees of freedom and expression still felt restrictive.

Only when I came across CI with it's somatic and awareness of body sensations
aspect did I really begin to understand and connect with a dance form that
truly feels like an art.

Non-competing in CI
* basketball - fun and joy corrupted with the intention of winning
* Dance - sense of judgement v/s feels good. Non-competing
