### Grounding and Trust

While attending a CI workshop in Goa, at a wonderful space under a huge Banyan
Tree with sunlight shimmering through it's leaves, having finished a set of
partner exercises we sat down in a circle to share our experiences and
feelings.
Two other participants began the sharing with how they where able to
trust each other letting them both share weight, lift and fly each other
easily.

Having sensed this theme of trust issues within the group, I chimed
in with my perspective on trust. I shared that indeed it is not only about
trusting the other but more so trusting oneself, to be able to sense, perceive
and catch myself in a fall. Being comfortable in different orientations and
knowing your center of gravity. That in turn lets you work within your limits
but also take risks leading to expansion of your capabilities and limits.

The facilitator resonated with me by adding that indeed trust is not something
that you just give, it comes from within by awareness of your presence
and body sensations leading to an even greater connection and perception of
the others presence and awareness.

The more I practise CI the more I find myself trusting my body and bodily sensations
to guide me into ways of catching myself from falls, having more spacial awareness
and reading my partners intentions.

This ties into the embodied aspect of Martial Arts as well. The more one is
empty of emotions, of fear, doubt and uncertainty the more one is grounded and
rooted. Hence it becomes ever so spontaneous to visualize and read not only
your own physical trajectory in space-time but with practise the opponents moves,
actions and eventually their subtle intentions.

###  Why I got into contact improvisation

I was never really drawn to the art form of dancing, the choreographed,
repeating patterns of steps shrieked me away from finding any joy in the act
of dancing. I always felt like being judged and objectified based purely on
how good I and my dance moves looked.

Even Latin-American partner dances with their rules and structures but a few degrees
of freedom and expression still felt restrictive.

Only when I came across CI with it's somatic and awareness of body sensations
aspect did I really begin to understand and connect with a dance
form that truly feels like an art.

Non-competing in CI
* basketball - fun and joy corrupted with the intention of winning
* Dance - sense of judgement v/s feels good. Non-competing

### Competition

Even though there's no element of competition in the structure of CI, we as
humans or the society we grow up in invariable conditions us to be
competitive. You can see the various personalities come out in the Jams,
there are those you have been practising CI for at least a few years and so
feel they are more experienced, skilled and just better than beginners.
