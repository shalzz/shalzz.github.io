No matter what we do in life, lasting satisfaction remains elusive.
Peace remains elusive.

Some people want to know, some want to meet, some want to be recognized,
and others simply want to talk and build friendships.

In life, there is no fun in being alone, yet there is no peace in the company
of others.  However, happiness is not a necessity of life. Peace is the most
precious thing of all.
