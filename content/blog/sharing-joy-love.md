The pain of not being able to share the joy and love you feel, with anyone,
again feels like a death process. The giving and receiving of love seems like
another duality. 

In a world craving for love, we find that love comes from within before it
comes from without, and when we find it within, there's an overwhelming sense
of sharing it without.

How do you share it when you finally have it? So far the problem was not
feeling love and compassion, now the problem is how to share it, if the other
is not in a position to receive it?  Both Physically and Energetically?

Physically, there are space and time constraints to sharing. There are rules,
ideas and our own personal blocks, limitations and boundaries.

Energetically, we can still yet have heart to heart communications beyond
space and time. However it's not so easy or natural for us yet to perceive
this energetic connection.

#### Growing from a two-dimensional love (between two people) to n-dimensional love (between you and everyone else/nature/universe/existence)

I'm thrown back to a sense of aloneness and separation from existence.
Important thing here is to feel and accept this yet more deeper level of aloneness
and separation.  Dropping down to a feeling at the core/stomach/navel of my
being.

A deeper awareness of my mind and thoughts and words and silence. Watching and
waiting. No ideas or expectations, no imagination, no fantasy or dreams can
hold my attention, everything real seems beyond the mind now. This feeling is
unexplained, so unexpected yet so simple.

My energy seems like it is in a dynamic of exchange both inside and out but
I'm so far unable to completely perceive this dynamic. 
There's yet again a tendency to attach or be identified with one expression of
this dynamic or play/exchange of energy, that felt good while it was alive and
present.

Now that the energy has expanded, one cannot crave or cling to the same
sense of expansion. Being and staying aware of the yet more greater joys and
bliss of expansion to come, in yet more unexpected, unimaginable ways and
synchronicity of energy dynamics and play and interactions.

Being intentional of my magnetic capacity and ability, of my own sense of self-worth
and self-love and what brings me joy and happiness without judging or
comparing myself to an idea of being happy or being in love.

A deeper acceptance of my own reality and facts of my being (aloneness,
sexuality, dreams) and embracing my worthiness though that acceptance.
