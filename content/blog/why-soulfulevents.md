Living and staying in a city, we look for things to do on a weekend as a fun
activity, going out or just entertainment to break out of from the work mindset
and schedule.

However we often end up falling into another set pattern and/or a repeating schedule,
working on the weekdays and partying/going out on the weekends.

[Soulful Events Newsletter][1] is as way to find meaningful events and activities to
do, that are enriching and nourishing to the body, mind or the soul
, ideally all of them, instead of just being a activity to pass away the time.

## Mission

Our goal is to create a community of early adopters of the New Earth. People
who are working on themselves and others via technology, products and various
works of arts to raise their and the collective consciousness of the society.

We do this by creating various platforms that act as a bazaar for exchange of
ideas, experiences and knowledge. As well as a place to meet and connect with
fellow travellers.

## Vision

The first vision of coordination is to enable a group of community leaders to
foster a sub-community in their own vicinity, online and/or offline, aided by
various tools and blueprints/techniques/processes curated and distributed
through our core community.

Most of the resources on self-exploration are shrouded by commercial gimmicks
and are out right scams that distract seeks from the true path. We achieve our
vision by mainly separating signal from noise and truths from half-truths.

The greatest tool in our mission is the referrals and recommendations of our
community members since truth itself cannot be shared directly but the ways of
igniting the spark in another can be.

### Target Audience

City dwelling seekers and pilgrims that are living within a society with
integration.

### Principles

Events that have an essences of self-exploration and inquiry. Performances, 
workshops and gatherings that, shares/creates a space from the experiences of their own journey 
towards inner peace and silence expressed through various means (music, dance,
art, poetry, etc) or teaches the way and techniques to others so they may walk 
the path and experience on their own.

While selecting/curating events it is good to think through various perspectives:

- Would you yourself like to go to such an event?
- Looking from the readers perspective, does the event page have enough information to make sense to the reader?
- Is it a purely commercial or entertaining event? If yes, then it’s most likely does not fit under soulful events

### Get Involved

If Soulful Events calls to you, sign up for the newsletter over at the
[Soulfulevents][1] website.

If there isn't a newsletter running for your city or town yet and you'd like to
lead the curation yourself, reach out to me for ways to contribute.

Described below is the process of how we generally structure a newsletter but
you'd have the flexibility and space to experiment your own style.

### The Process

We create different sections within the soulful events newsletter for other 
cities/locations and give access to the respective curators of that location.

If there’s multiple people curating for a location it’s recommend to create a 
draft of the post on a real-time editing platform like Google docs or 
[hack.md](http://hack.md) since the ghost/substack editor does not work well for multiple people editing at the same time.

Things to note:

- Published every Wednesday
- Format:
    - Event title:  Links to the event page, day, date (all in bold)
    - Description:  Limit to one paragraph that covers the gist of the event.
                    For more details readers can visit the event page
