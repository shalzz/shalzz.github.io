### Mayor system

1. Mayor and the Council System
1. Individual Representatives Elected at district level
1. District Representatives form a Council to the city/town
1. Council Members vote to elect a Mayor of the city/town/state
1. Parties allowed to form but representatives stand as independent candidates
    i.e no party ticket required and cannot assume a party manifesto as candidates
    manifesto or fight only on the basis of being a party member.
1. Parties play a roll only at and above the Council level.
1. More than two parties considered healthy
1. Mayors of cities/states vote to elect one among themselves as the Prime Minister.
1. Alternatively Mayors vote to elect two/three Prime Minister Candidates among
    themselves who fight for the peoples vote to become the Prime Minister.
1. Once a Mayor is elected as the Prime Minister, that Mayor's council votes again to
    elect another mayor for the city/state.
1. Any Individual convicted of a major crime (more than 5 years in jail) cannot run
    as a candidate for state or federal government.

### State Independence

Majority of power at the lowest levels.

1. Independent State Governments
1. State Governments are completely independent. Can chose to enact their own laws.
1. Federal Laws need majority approval from all states.
1. State Governments control all local laws, municipal corporations,
    Public sector Utilities (PSU), Police, etc

### Political Accountability

1. People can via protests, debates, civil right law suites and court rulings decide
    to remove a Mayor from office before his term is over.
1. In case a Mayor is removed before his term is over either the council elects another
    Mayor or fresh elections for the complete council are held.
1. The police is directly answerable to the Mayor and his/her council.
    Federal Government cannot and should not interfere with the local police of a
    state.
1. The police is also accountable to the people via the Judiciary system, Journalism
    and various independent/federal anti-corruption, anti-abuse of power departments conducting
    yearly audits and inspections.
1. The judiciary maintains a district attorney office that has the power to prosecute
    and bring to court any government official in the police force,
    state government or the federal government and can bring lawsuits on its own
    or on behalf of a citizen.
1. A clear distinction between police and military to be maintained at all times.
1. At no point is it justified to militarise the police.
1. Community-led policing show be encourages and enforced in rural areas/low density
   areas and not have a state back police in force.
1. Areas that do have an active police force will be under the purview of a civilian
    oversight committee to keep in check abuse of power and conflicts of interests.

### Abuse of powers due to ambiguity in laws

1. No political party can contest for elections with a religious motive or have any
    specific religious issues as part of their manifesto to uphold the constitution
    right of secularism (This has to be enforced by the Election Commission among others).
1. Freedom of Speech and right to expression should have a overriding effect,
    be clarified and all possible major violations should be listed.
1. Ambiguities in free speech should be cleared and rights of citizens towards
    free speech should be explained and made aware to every citizen.
    (Though awareness campaigns, at court proceedings,  at the time of arrest
    and various NGO's and organisations)
1. Any law that aims to preemptively arrest, prosecute or justify violence or police
    action leading to lose of life or fundamental rights of citizens with the pretense
    of preventing a crime or harm to anyone or general public cannot be allowed due to undermining
    civil liberties and general abuse of power. Any such actions if absolutely
    necessary has to be taken with explicit permission from a public court.

### Effect

This brings the question; How does a democratic society goes on to bring about a
change as drastic as some of these to the point of needing to redraft the constitution.

It is clear that a system is resistant to change to anything that undermines the
fundamental structure of a system: in other words a broken system cannot possibly
be used to fix that very system.

Therefore, we as a society, need to be aware of this and come up with means of
overthrowing a governance model that is by consensus broken beyond repair.

Some of the traditional mechanisms so far have been that have been used:
* Large scale Protests
* Armed Revolution
* Civil War Movements
* Non-Violent Revolution (but self-inflicting violence; hunger strikes, shutdown strikes, etc)
